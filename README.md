# dynCluster: dynamic Cluster algorithm

* There are two ways to use the code, i.e. use it as CPP program, or create R functions via Rcpp.

* To compile the CPP exectutable ZTM, at the UNIX/LINUX prompt:

   * make clean
   * make

* To include the CPP as the extension of R, you need to do the following

    1. at UNIX/LINUX prompt:
```
           make clean
```
    2. run the script in `ztm.R` (there are examples)

    Note: The `Rcpp` procedure has texted on Adroit, Tukey and Hecate.

Note: The purpose of `make clean` is remove the `*.o` that may be generated for different purposes.

    * Generated by the `Cpp/g++` compiler (i.e. make).
    * Generated by the `Rcpp` compiler for R.
